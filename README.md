# Steam Turbine Flow Path Design Software (STFPD)

## About
User-friendly software specialized in steam turbine system scheme design

## Motivation
The design of a steam turbine's thermal system was complicated in its iterative and high-dimensional nature and involves hundreds if not thousands of parameters. 
In hope of making things easier for designers, I came up with this user friendly design software that can generate a solution with just a few clicks.

## Story Behind
I independently developed this software based on the OOP paradigm and the MVC software architecture pattern from scratch during years 2012 - 2013. At that time the only CS courses I've taken was "Introduction to the C Language" and "Data Structure".<br>

To make this happen, I self-taught all relavant knowledges including object oriented programming, the pascal language, design patterns, the MVC software architecture, as well as delphi.<br>

The software was later used in designing a megawatt level solar thermal power plantâ€™s turbine system near Liangzi River in Wuhan.
