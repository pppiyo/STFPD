Steam Turbine Flow Path Design Software

I independently developed this piece of user-friendly software specialized in steam turbine system scheme design based on 
the OOP paradigm and the MVC software architecture pattern using the Pascal language from scratch during year 2012 - 2013.

At that time the only CS courses I've taken was introduction to the C language in 2007 and data structure in 2009, which means
I self-taught all relavant knowledges including object oriented programming, the pascal language, design patterns, the MVC software architecture, delphi to make this software happen.

This software was later used in designing a megawatt level solar thermal power plantâ€™s turbine system near Liangzi River in Wuhan.
